                <h3>Hippo in the Drink</h3>
                <p>Fish Haven, known for its incredible fishing, has provided us with something new. Alex and Alexie Summers were met with a surprise this past Saturday when they dropped their boat into the water at Fish Lake. “We were just going for our limit ( of fish), we did not expect what we caught!” The previous week Alexie had caught an incredible, record 10lb Rainbow trout. Little did she know she was about to break her record. After 30 minutes on the lake they noticed something swimming in the water close to their boat. “We thought it must be a beaver,” Alex told us, “but beavers don’t normally swim toward people”. As the creature got closer the two were able to see two large nostrils and the two wiggling ears of hippo! That’s right, a hippopotamus was found in Fish Lake.<br> Authorities were immediately called to the scene, and the hippo, a 132lb juvenile, was brought to the shore where he was placed in the care of the Forest Rangers. Ranger Torus said, “This is a first for me. It’s a first for anyone!” Authorities believe the hippo may have been a personal pet until he grew too big and was released into the wild. Ranger Torus asked that those who might be inclined to order a hippopotamus for Christmas this year take the time to realize that baby hippos grow to well over three thousand pounds, and that it is, of course, illegal.</p>
