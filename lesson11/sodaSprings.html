                <h3>King Arthur Retires</h3>
                <p>King Arthur, or ‘Art’, the sled dog finally retires after an impressive thirteen years in the harness. An incredible lead sled dog by all accounts, Art has toyed with the idea of retirement for the past few years. Each day as the rest of his team would prepare for a run, Art could be found on the cot right next to the fire, but as soon as it was time to go he just knew and was out in the middle of the rest of the dogs ready to be strapped in. The deciding great deciding factor in his retirement this year was due to an injury he sustained last year. He received great care and was able to pull through and even continue working. That’s just the type of dog he is.<br>
                He has had an incredible career, including working with John Gunderson, future sheriff of Soda Springs, and winning the illustrious American Dog Derby. Well done Art, certainly a well-deserved retirement! Now Art will work on becoming the number one in couch cuddling and leave the racing to his many offspring.
